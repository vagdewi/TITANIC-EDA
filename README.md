# TITANIC-EDA
In this EDA, first load the Titanic dataset using the read_csv() method of the pandas library. Use the head() method to preview the first few rows of the dataset and the isnull().sum() method to check for missing values.

Then use various visualization techniques from the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to explore the data. We first use a countplot to explore the distribution of the target variable, which is whether a passenger survived or not. Use countplots to explore the relationship between survival and gender, and survival and passenger class. Finally, we use histplots to explore the distribution of age and fares.

These simple EDA techniques give us a good understanding of the Titanic dataset.
